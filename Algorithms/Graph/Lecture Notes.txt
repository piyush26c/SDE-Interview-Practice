Graph Series:
	| _ Storing a graph:
	|	| _ Adjacency List
	|	| _ Adjacency Matrix
	|	| _ Edge List
	|	| _ 2D Matrix (Implicit Graph)
	|
	| _ Applications of graph
	|	| _ shortest path
	|	| _ social network
	|	| _ shortest cyclic route
	|	| _ dependency graph (Directed Acyclic graphs)
	|	| _ routing algorithms
	|	| _ computation graphs (deep learning)
	|	| _ computer vision (image segmentation, flood fill)
	|	| _ web crawler
	|	| _ graph databases (ex. Neo4j)

	| _ Types of graph:
		| _ weighted graphs
		| _ unweighted graphs
		| _ directed graphs
		| _ undirected graphs
			| _ all edges are bidirectional
